    Tech Talk Requirements
  </h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Goal:</strong> To become comfortable sharing ideas with groups of your peers by talking about something you're passionate about.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a time for you to geek out over anything you want. In the real world, you will often need to describe complex technical concepts to people who have no idea what you do. You might have to meet with clients and determine their project requirements. You might be working with a group and have to convince them the best way to solve an issue. These talks are helpful way to practice.

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Topics must be approved <strong>two weeks</strong> before your scheduled presentation.  <span class="eight">(5pts)</span></li>
    <li>An outline of your talk must be submitted to me via Slack <strong>one week</strong> before your scheduled presentation.  <span class="eight">(5pts)</span></li>
    <li>Talks must be <strong>around 15 minutes long</strong>. Don't go under, but try not to go over either.  <span class="eight">(5pts)</span>
      <ul>
        <li>This doesn't include time for questions afterwards.</li>
        <li>If you show a video, that does not count for your talk's length. This is for <em>you</em> to tell us about a thing, not for someone else to tell us about it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You should have some sort of presentation to accompany your talk. Don't just read from the slides! Use them to help us understand your topic or to keep us interested.  <span class="eight">(5pts)</span></li>
    <li>Give us some ways to keep learning about your topic, like links to articles, books, or videos to explore further.  <span class="eight">(5pts)</span></li>
    <li>Have fun with it and get excited about your topic. How can we get excited for it if you aren't excited for it?</li>

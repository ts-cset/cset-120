  <h1>Midterm Project: Portfolio</h1>

  <p>You've learned a lot this semester: from basic command line tools to complex git workflows, from HTML semantics to organizing large pages and projects, from simple text formatting with CSS to all the ways to make the same layout with different properties.</p>

  <p>Now you'll put it all together and build your own portfolio website!</p>

  <h2>Planning</h2>

  <p>Remember <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure#Planning_a_simple_website">this exercise</a>? I want you to plan your portfolio in the same way. If you don't know what a portfolio is, here are some of my favorite examples of designers and developers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://danmall.me/" target="_blank">Dan Mall</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://chriscoyier.net/" target="_blank">Chris Coyier</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Drasner</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://bradfrost.com/" target="_blank">Brad Frost</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bripiccari.me/" target="_blank">Bri Piccari</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.laurenhallden.com/" target="_blank">Lauren Hallden</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Of course, these are from professionals. I won't compare your portfolio to theirs, and neither should you! Portfolios are a medium to show what <strong>you</strong> are capable of. They are a place for you to experiment with new techniques and prove that you can use the tools and languages that are listed on your resume. Use these websites as inspiration for what you hope to learn and be able to build soon. Here are some examples of students portfolios from previous years:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://s1eepingp0wder.github.io/" target="_blank">Danny Liehr</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://zmwaite182.github.io" target="_blank">Zane Waite</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://zachlehman99.github.io" target="_blank">Zach Lehman</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://snauman817.github.io/" target="_blank">Spencer Nauman</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>To plan your site, follow the same exercise in the MDN article above and plan out all of your pages on paper. Think of this as a rough draft. Here are some things you should think about:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What content do you want on your portfolio? (e.g. About page? Resume? Contact Info? Projects?)</li>
    <li>How many different types of pages will you need for that content? (e.g. Will your project pages have a different layout than your homepage?)</li>
    <li>How will you create the content? (e.g. Is it all text or do you have some images? How will you show your projects?)</li>
    <li>Do you own all of your content? (e.g. Don't steal content. <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice description of some common software licenses that you might find on Github.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Setup</h2>

  <p>Follow <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">this article</a> to set up your repository. <strong>It's incredibly important that you follow their directions or else your project will not be deployed properly!</strong> We will discuss Github Pages in class, but this is a service that serves your git repo at a specific URL so your HTML files will become a real website!</p>

        <td>Lack of effort in creating personalized content. Minimal attempt at designing layouts. Plan asks more questions than it answers.</td>
        <td>Planned content is high quality and personalized. Designs show an attempt at distinct layouts for distinct content, but also show a cohesive and consistent site.</td>

        <th>HTML Syntax</th>
        <td>The code contains a multitude of errors: misspellings, unclosed tags, malformed attributes, or overlapping tags.</td>
        <td>The code passes validation and shows a thorough understanding of the rules of syntax.</td>

      <tr>
        <th>HTML Semantics</th>
        <td>Content is commonly described by improper tags when a better tag would suffice.</td>
        <td>Content is well described by tags and the student has shown effort in finding and understanding the appropriate tag.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>CSS Syntax</th>
        <td>The code contains a multitude of errors: misspellings, improper punctuation, non-existent properties or property values, or incorrect values for a given property.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>CSS Quality</th>
        <td>Styles contain many irrelevant, unused, redundant, or incorrect styles. The rules work against the cascade and frequently overwrite each other.</td>
        <td>Styles are not over or under engineered, meaning there is just enough CSS to display the styles without redundancies or irrelevant rules.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Code Style</th>
        <td>Code is illegible, poorly indented, or messy.</td>

        <td>The site has been deployed to a URL and there are no broken links.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Project Structure</th>
        <td>Files for code and other assets are disorganized, poorly named, or are not separated into distinct parts.</td>
        <td>All files are in a proper directory organized by context and all names are meaningful.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Content</th>
        <td>There is minimal content, either copy or images, or the content is a poor quality or is not personalized to the individual.</td>
        <td>There is sufficient high-quality content to show your distinct personality and skill set.</td>

        <th>Git Workflow</th>
        <td>Commits are few and far between, have unclear messages, or contain sloppy snapshots of development.</td>
        <td>Commits are frequent, contain a small amount of related work, and their messages describe the exact work done.</td>

  <h2>Launch</h2>

  <p>The portfolios will be due <strong>by midnight on Sunday, Oct. 13th</strong>. Make sure you've commited all your changes, pushed them to Github, and merged them into the master branch so that they'll be live on your production site!</p>

  <p>We will show off our creations in class the following few days. Each of you will get to walk us through your site on the projector and share your thoughts on the project. Here are some questions I'll ask you:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Walk us through your portfolio site and tell us about your planning process. What aspects of planning were helpful? What parts were difficult?</li>
    <li>Did you have to change your plan for any reason? If so, why?</li>
    <li>Did you learn and use any new CSS property or HTML tag that we haven't talked about yet?</li>
    <li>Was there anything especially puzzling that took you a while to figure out?</li>
    <li>What do you want to learn about so you can add it to your portfolio later?</li>
    <li>What is something you are particularly proud of?</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Project: Portfolio</h1>

  <p>
    You took some time to think about your message, now you have some words on a page. With that content, you can finally start to define a layout and create elements of a design for that content.

    This phase of the project is usually done by an experienced web designer who creates the deliverables for you to build as a developer. Maybe that means a low-fidelity wireframe and moodboard, or maybe that means a functional high-fidelity prototype using a design tool like Adobe XD or Figma. Because we're focusing on development more than design, I'll let you decide how far you want to dive into this process.

  <p>
    You can work on simple sketches and provide a list of colors you like. Or you can find a tool to build a more complete mock-up. The choice is yours.

  <p>
    What is most important, though, is that you start thinking about how to employ a design to communicate your content in the best way possible. You might want to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/wiki/principles">explore some principles of good design</a> so that you have some good rules to follow.

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>For each of your layouts, create a higher fidelity design to work off of.</li>
    <li>Don't forget responsiveness! You should show how content might react at different screen sizes.</li>
    <li>You should have a good idea of your color palette.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <strong>Do not start coding yet!</strong> This is the last step. Once we have an idea of the design, it's off to the races!

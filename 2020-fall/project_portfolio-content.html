  <h1>Project: Portfolio</h1>

  <p>
    If you've completed the Planning Phase, then you have a good idea of the site's Information Architecture. Now you need to develop and expand on these ideas by creating or gathering the content.

  <h2>Phase 2: Content</h2>

  <p>
    Readings:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/comprehensive-website-planning-guide-part1/">Smashing Magazine: A Comprehensive Website Planning Guide (Part 1)</a>. The whole article is worth reading sometime, but start halfway down in the section called "Needs Assessment." This will talk you through some basic principles of branding guidelines.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/content-strategy.html">Usability.gov: Content Strategy</a>. Some best practices for sites of all sizes to create meaningful and relevant content.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>
    Time to write our content! You'll create a text file for each of the pages you defined in the planning phase and fill out that page with content. You'll write all the text you need, create or gather any other assets like images or graphs, and put it all inside these files.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> you aren't creating HTML files. You can't mark up your content if you don't have it yet. So split up the problems and focus on one at a time.

    <li>It should be written in plain text or very simple Markdown, no HTML.</li>
    <li>You need to commit the content to the GitHub repository and organize it according to your plan.</li>

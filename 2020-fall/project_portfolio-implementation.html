    Most people think this phase is the hardest, but you've really done all the hard parts already: the thinking. Coming up with a plan is usually more difficult than following it, but that's because it's hard to come up with a plan that you can't follow. Sure, there will be some fine details you have to work out yet. But all you have to do now is sit down and get to developing.

    Make sure you turn on GitHub Pages in the repo settings to see your content live and make sure your hyperlinks work sooner than later. Then you can code locally and commit as normal, only pushing when you want to update the live site with those changes. If the changes don't show up immediately, have some patience. It takes some time for GitHub to rebuild your site and for caches to clear.

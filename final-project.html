  <h1>Final Project: JS Game</h1>

  <p>This is the capstone project to your first semester as a developer. You're going to build and deploy a game of your choice using all the skills and technologies you've learned so far. And we'll be following a modern development workflow through it all.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Planning</h2>

  <p>Your group will need to decide on a game to make. This can either be a brand new creation of your own or a remake of a well-known classic. It's up to your group to decide something that you're all excited about. Make sure it's a challenge to build, but within your capabilities. Just in case your game is not approved, come up with one or two backup options.</p>
  
  <p>Talk with your group over the Thanksgiving break and come up with a detailed description of the game, in writing. Send it to me over Slack for approval. You should start creating your master story list, too. It doesn't need to be completed, but you need to have a good idea of all the user stories that you need, or want, to build.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Git Workflow</h2>

  <p>Your group should set up a git repo that contains your game's files. The other partner should be added to the repo as a contributor (See the repo settings page). You will be using the centralized workflow, so you don't have to worry about branches. As each of you do work, commit on master, and either pull then merge or pull with a rebase to get your partner's changes.</p>
  
  <p>You should be reviewing each other's code as it's merge it in. I'll be able to review the contribution history via git to see who did what work and if each team member did an equal portion of the work.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Agile Workflow</h2>

  <p>After your pitched project is given the green light, you'll need to complete your master story list. That is all the stories necessary for the completion of your game as well as some extra optional stories that you hope to accomplish. Prior to starting code, we'll do an Agile planning day where you will estimate and prioritize your user stories. You can use these estimates to have an idea about when you'll complete the game, hopefully within the deadline.</p>

  <p>For such a short timeline, we'll have very small iterations. We'll do a daily stand-up to monitor the project's progress and determine priorities for the day. And we'll keep a Kanban board to track story progress and groom the backlog.</p>

        <td>Lack of effort in creating personalized content. Minimal attempt at designing layouts. Plan asks more questions than it answers.</td>

        <th>HTML Syntax</th>
        <td>The code contains a multitude of errors: misspellings, unclosed tags, malformed attributes, or overlapping tags.</td>

        <th>HTML Semantics</th>
        <td>Content is commonly described by improper tags when a better tag would suffice.</td>

        <th>CSS Syntax</th>
        <td>The code contains a multitude of errors: misspellings, improper punctuation, non-existent properties or property values, or incorrect values for a given property.</td>

        <th>CSS Positioning</th>
        <td>Positioning is either over- or under-engineered, meaning there is either an abundance of competing rules to place elements or little to no attempt to place elements.</td>
        <td>Multiple positioning styles have been attempted and there is just enough rules to make it happen without extraneous, useless declarations.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Code Style</th>
        <td>Code is illegible, poorly indented, or messy.</td>

        <th>Project Structure</th>
        <td>Files for code and other assets are disorganized, poorly named, or are not separated into distinct parts.</td>

        <th>Content</th>
        <td>There is minimal content, either copy or images, or the content is a poor quality or is not personalized to the individual.</td>

        <th>Git Workflow</th>
        <td>There is only one branch. No Pull Requests were opened to merge features into the master branch. Commits are poorly named or contain sloppy snapshots of development.</td>
        <td>Commits are atomic and messages describe the exact work done. Branches have been created for individual features and they have been merged into the master branch according to the Pull Request process.</td>

  <h2>Launch</h2>

  <p>The games will be due <strong>by midnight on Thursday, Dec. 12th</strong>. Make sure you've commited all your changes, pushed them to Github, and merged them into the master branch so that they'll be live on your production site! That means you need to setup GitHub Pages for the project.</p>

  <p>We will show off our creations for our last day of class. Each of you will get to walk us through your game and your development process.</p>
